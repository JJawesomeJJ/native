This paper studies the live transmission system, using Ubuntu as the server, openresty (nginx embedded in Lua) as the reverse agent, and Android (using Java as the core development, HTML5, CSS3, JS, as a hybrid development) mobile phone is the live streaming terminal, Tencent cloud live streaming is the most streaming destination, PHP (awesome PHP self-developed PHP framework) is the back-end API development, and live CMS system development, MySQL is the database, redis is the cache, and rabbitmq message middleware is added. The transmission protocol uses HTTP as the communication mode of API, web socket (swoole) as the timely communication scheme, and RTMP as the communication protocol of video transmission. In Android system, RTMP protocol is used to transmit HD audio and video, the data transmission strategy of RTMP is optimized, and the wireless transmission of HD audio and video is realized.
